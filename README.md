== koa-oop

An example as how one might build a koajs app made of ES6 classes, hopefully
resulting in clean and readable code.  Not much other than syntactic sugar over
koa, but hope you find it sweet.

== features

* keep api routes and project structure in sync
* use predicates to decorate paths/methods with additional functionality such as permission checking


== get started

```
npm install
node index.js
```
